# SmartSweep Precision 🤖

## Introduction 📖
Welcome to the SmartSweep Precision Project! This project aims to create a versatile and efficient cleaning robot using Arduino. The robot is designed to autonomously navigate and clean designated areas, providing a smart and hands-free cleaning solution.

## Features 🚀
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot utilizes sensors and algorithms to navigate through the cleaning area intelligently.
- **Advanced dirt removal**: The new innovative brush can remove persistent dirt particles, ensuring thorough cleaning.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The robot intelligently avoids obstacles in its path, ensuring a safe cleaning process.

## Installation 🛠️
1. **MicroPython:** Install MicroPython on your Arduino board using [this guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/giga-r1-wifi/giga-micropython).
2. **Fork:** Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`
3. **Install:** Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Sync:** Sync the program using `python sync.py` to your Arduino board

## Usage 📝
